# n1.care

> AI-powered clinical health intelligence platform for licensed healthcare professionals.

n1.care transforms unstructured medical records into structured, actionable health intelligence. Clinicians upload patient records (PDFs, imaging reports, genetics reports, clinical notes), and the AI pipeline extracts biomarkers, diagnoses, procedures, and genetic data into four structured categories. Multiple AI-powered report types are generated for different clinical needs.

The platform is designed exclusively for licensed healthcare professionals. AI provides draft outputs that are fully editable — the clinician always has final authority. Nothing reaches a patient without explicit clinician sign-off.
